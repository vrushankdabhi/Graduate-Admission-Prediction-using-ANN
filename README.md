# Graduate Admission Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks

![Graduate Admission](https://link-to-your-image.com/graduate-admission.jpg)

## Overview

This project aims to predict the chances of a student's admission to a graduate program based on various academic and test score features. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to model and predict the probability of admission. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and preparing the dataset for model training.
- **ANN Model**: Implementation of a fully connected neural network for regression analysis.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Training the ANN on the dataset and evaluating its performance.
- **Visualization**: Displaying model performance metrics and prediction results.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Serial No.**: Unique identifier for each record.
- **GRE Score**: Graduate Record Examination score (out of 340).
- **TOEFL Score**: Test of English as a Foreign Language score (out of 120).
- **University Rating**: Rating of the university (on a scale of 1 to 5).
- **SOP**: Strength of Statement of Purpose (on a scale of 1 to 5).
- **LOR**: Strength of Letter of Recommendation (on a scale of 1 to 5).
- **CGPA**: Cumulative Grade Point Average (out of 10).
- **Research**: Research experience (0 or 1).
- **Chance of Admit**: Probability of admission (output feature, between 0 and 1).

## Results

The ANN model provides accurate predictions of the chance of admission, demonstrating the relationship between input features and admission probability.
